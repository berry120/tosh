# Tosh
Tosh is a game similar to Balderdash, Fibbage, Fictionary and others. Fool your opponents by providing wrong answers for them to guess!

## Why?!
It seemed like a fun project, and I wanted to take [Quarkus](http://quarkus.io) for a spin.

## Try it
You'll need at least two players with smartphones, and a main machine to run the display screen on. Sound good? Head here to give it a spin:

*(Note that this is just a free Heroku instance built from the latest repository code, so it won't be the fastest and may not always be working / available.)*
